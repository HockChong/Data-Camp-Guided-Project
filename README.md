# Data-Camp-Guided-Project

I used the guided project to apply the data analytics skills I learned to solved the real-world problems.

## SQL

1. [Analyze International Debt Statistics](https://github.com/HockChong/Data-Camp-Guided-Project/blob/main/SQL/Analyze%20International%20Debt%20Statistics.ipynb)
    * Write SQL queries to answer interesting questions about international debt using data from The World Bank.
 
## Python 

1. [Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office](https://github.com/HockChong/Data-Camp-Guided-Project/blob/main/Python/Investigating%20Netflix%20Movies%20and%20Guest%20Stars%20in%20The%20Office/notebook.ipynb)
    * Apply the foundational Python skills you learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python by manipulating and visualizing movie and TV data.

2. [The GitHub History of the Scala Language](https://github.com/HockChong/Data-Camp-Guided-Project/blob/main/Python/The%20GitHub%20History%20of%20the%20Scala%20Language/notebook.ipynb)
    * Find the true Scala experts by exploring its development history in Git and GitHub.
    
3. [The Android App Market on Google Play](https://github.com/HockChong/Data-Camp-Guided-Project/blob/main/Python/The%20Android%20App%20Market%20on%20Google%20Play/The%20Android%20App%20Market%20on%20Google%20Play.ipynb)
